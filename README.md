# rand

Package rand is an easy way to generate pseudo-random numbers. You
don't have to worry about seeding or reseeding. Ask for a number, get
a random one --- every time. It's safe for security-sensitive work and
safe for access from multiple goroutines.

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/mndrix/rand
